# CS361, Spring 2021 Dispatcher
For each (emergency, vehicle) pair, the program prints a message indicating the total time reuqired for the fastest path from the vehicle to the emergency location that does not exceed the allotted maximum number of potholes.

It is possible that no such path from the vehicle to the emergency location exists, in which case a message to that effect will be printed.

The boosted folder requires boost library to run, some warnings are yet to be resolved.
